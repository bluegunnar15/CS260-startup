# CS260-startup
startup project for cs260

Notes from css simon:
  * "text-align:center;" <- centers text
  * <main class="container-fluid bg-secondary text-center"> <- means background secondary color, text center.
        You can add certain characteristics to the class name. 


CSS Notes:
  * padding-left: 1em; <- How to indent

WHat I learned from Simon HTML: I did not know that you could do pre extensions to links. Not sure if that makes sense but for example, I did not know that https://simon.dumbquestions.click could be a valid link. 

HTML Notes:
  * div <- new line
  * span <- continue on the line
  * nav <- navigation, can put organize vertically or horizontally using div or span
  * ul <- unordered list
  * li <- list
  * table <- table with tr as rows, and th as cells
  * alt <- "alternative text"
  * img <- image
  * svg <- "scalable vector graphics" allows to create images within html
  * canvas <- similiar to svg, allows image creation in html but requres Javacript

Website(updated for https): https://dumbquestions.click

IP address to website: http://13.59.126.80

Cool terminal commands:
   * dig amazon.com <- gets IP address associated with domain 
   * whois byu.edu <- gets information about a domain name from the domain name
   * traceroute byu.edu <- the path my computer takes to connect to byu.edu
