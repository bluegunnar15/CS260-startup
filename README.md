The Pitch
POV Opinions:

POV Opinions is a forum like website where users can post and debate light hearted controversial questions from their points of view. Some of these types of questions include: Is water wet? Dark or milk chocolate? Peel or bite string cheese? The list of questions grows as more users add their own questions. 
The website consists of a list of questions posted by various users. Upon clicking on a question you can read the authors question, their own opinion, other users comments, and there is even an opinion to vote with the overall results being shown.
