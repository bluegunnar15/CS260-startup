# CS260-startup
startup project for cs260
This is me, modifing the readme file again on github, changing this line too
change made: a typo from above


What I learned from this assignment: 
I have used github before but I learned how to merge conflicts in the branch history. While I still am not 100% confident with merge errors, I understand how to fix most merge problems.
